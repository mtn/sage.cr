# sage.cr

A port of [sage](https://github.com/mtn/sage) to crystal. I'd been meaning to try this language out for over a year :)

Crystal seems like an interesting language. This project is the full extent to which I've used it, but I generally enjoyed its type system and syntax. I'm not sure I'll be using it again, though.

## Usage

Build with `make`, then run the executable `main` on any of the examples. For example,

    $ make; ./main examples/hello.bf
    Hello World!
